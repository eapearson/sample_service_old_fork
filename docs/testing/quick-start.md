1. Setup host environment for testing:

```shell
make test-setup
```

If any errors are reported, consult [the troubleshooting document](./troubleshooting.md).

2. Run tests:

```shell

```

3. When tests are successfully completed, a coverage summary will be displayed, and a human-readable coverage report will be available in [html_cov/index.html](../../html_cov/index.html)`.
